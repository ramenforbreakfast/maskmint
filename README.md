# MaskMint

### A Special ERC-20 Token Deployer For HashMask Owners!

#### Tokens deployed by MaskMint are attached to a specific mask and have special properties for mask owners embedded in them:
  * Any minted supply goes directly to the current mask owner
  * Mask owners can change the name/symbol of their token

#### MaskMint token contracts also have a few other features separating them from generic ERC-20s:
  * Anyone can mint tokens by burning an equivalent amount of NCT
  * Every token contract has a max supply defined by the amount of NCT a mask has generated up to that point

#### Come and create a token for your HashMask @ [maskmint.app](https://www.maskmint.app)
